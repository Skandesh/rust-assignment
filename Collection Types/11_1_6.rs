/*
Usually strings are stored in heap memory and they usually are presented in form of blocks which is designed by the system'sarchitecture itself.
Memory blocks are generally grouped as 8 (or) 16 bits. 
Capacity is space of one such block where future elements will be added into it

Here we have specified the capacity to be 25, even if there are no string/elements it's length would be 0 but the capacity remains 25 as specified.
if the vector's length crosses 25, the capacity would be automatically reallocated to some other memory location.
